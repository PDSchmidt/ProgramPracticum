Assignment 5 was an assignment built across multiple stages implementing the cumulative knowledge from the course.

The project outcome was to make a pseudo "Paint-like" graphics program in Java.

Features include:
-Four drawing implements: Rectangle, Ellipse, Line, and Pencil
-Tool Thickness Option
-Color Chooser
-Fill/No Fill Option

Extra Features I'd like to implement:
-Saving/Loading an image
-Draw Layer Option (toggle)
